# Adaptive Distributed Multi-Level Index (ADMI)

## Overview

The Adaptive Distributed Multi-Level Index (ADMI) is a novel approach to indexing and querying data in distributed systems. ADMI aims to optimize system performance by dynamically adapting its data partitioning and indexing strategies based on workload characteristics and system conditions. It incorporates multi-level index structures and intelligent query routing and load balancing mechanisms to enable efficient data operations.

This repository contains an implementation of ADMI, along with a simple user interface for performing queries and adapting system settings.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Partitioning:** Adaptive partitioning of data across nodes to balance data load and minimize inter-node communication overhead.

- **Multi-Level Indexing:** Global and local indexes for efficient indexing and lookup operations.

- **Intelligent Query Routing and Load Balancing:** Queries are routed to the appropriate nodes and tasks are evenly distributed to maximize system throughput and minimize response times.

- **Adaptive Techniques:** ADMI dynamically adjusts its index structure and data partitioning based on system performance metrics and changes in workload.

## Getting Started

To get started with ADMI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/igorsuvorov/big-data-admi.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd big-data-admi`

## Usage

1. **Enter Query Target:** Enter the specific data value you are searching for in the system and click "Search". The system will perform the search and display the results.

2. **Enter Metrics Load:** Input the query load metric to adapt the indexing and partitioning of the system to optimize performance. If the query load or system load is over 100, the system will re-index and re-partition data.
